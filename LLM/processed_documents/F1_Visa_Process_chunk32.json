    "ChunkText": "most denials are based on 214b this means you did not establish that you are eligible for an f-1 visa, usually because you did not satisfy the visa officer that your goals in the US are in line with the kind of visa you are asking for. be sure to ask the officer interviewing you for a more specific reason!",
    "ContextBefore": "sometimes something as simple as a misunderstanding on the part of the officer interviewing you can lead to a denial.",
    "ContextAfter": "they should be able to explain to you why you were not eligible, and this will help you understand and decide if you want to apply again. if you plan to apply again be sure to be prepared to address the issue that caused the first denial."
