    "ChunkText": "please note that if you will take some credits at another school during a semester, you will need to provide isss with a copy of your course schedule.",
    "ContextBefore": "this can only be up to half of your total credits during a fall or spring semester, but in summer or winter sessions you can take as many credits as you like at another school without enrolling at umbc, since enrollment during those sessions is not required, unless you plan to complete your academic program during a summer term.",
    "ContextAfter": "we are required by law to verify your full-time enrollment each semester, and will need to be able to report how many credits you are taking at another school to make sure that, combined with your umbc courses, you meet the minimum full-time requirements."
