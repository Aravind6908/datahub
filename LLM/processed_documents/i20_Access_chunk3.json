    "ChunkText": "what if i will attend my first semester remotely from home? your I-20 has a program start date that must reflect the first semester you will be physically on umbcs campus.",
    "ContextBefore": "you will need to print the signed i-20, sign it in ink with a blue pen, and then take that physical document to your visa appointment. you will carry this document with you through immigration as well. if i defer my admission to a new semester, do i need a new i-20?",
    "ContextAfter": "if you have been issued an I-20 for a previous semester, but will not physically come to umbcs campus until a later semester, you will need to submit a new new f-1 student request through the isss portal to receive an updated document. your I-20 is not automatically updated."
