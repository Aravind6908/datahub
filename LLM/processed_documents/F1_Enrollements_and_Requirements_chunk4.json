    "ChunkText": "for example, an undergraduate could take one online course for 3 credits, 3 regular courses for 9 credits, and thats the required 12. beyond the required 12, an additional online course could be taken.",
    "ContextBefore": "undergraduate students- undergrads are required to enroll in a minimum of 12 credits per semester. one class is typically 3 or 4 credits. online coursework immigration regulations allow for one online class per semester towards your minimum requirement. you could take additional online courses beyond your minimum enrollment as well, if you like.",
    "ContextAfter": "online courses can be taken as much as you like in summer or winter sessions, when enrollment is not required, unless you plan to complete your academic program during a summer term, in which case you must follow all full-time enrollment rules and are only permitted to take at most one fully-online course."
