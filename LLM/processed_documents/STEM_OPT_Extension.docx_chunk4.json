    "Text": "The ISSS office will review each STEM OPT request and email the student about any potential edits students should make on their draft Form I-765. Students will also be able to view their STEM OPT I-20 in their request. Students must print out and sign their STEM OPT I-20 with blue ink. Submitting an application without a signature will result in a denial. Finally, students must upload all required documentation and submit their I-765 application using the USCIS online application system. The current fee for submitting an I-765 is $470. I-765 Filing Tips BEFORE YOU SUBMIT: Double check to see if \u201cSTEM OPT Requested\u201d with the requested start and end dates is on the second page of your I-20! If you submit your STEM OPT application to USCIS without this STEM OPT request listed, it will be automatically denied! Step 3: Track Case Status After submitting an application to USCIS, students will receive an I-797 Receipt Notice with a case number. Students can track the status of their application by entering their case number on the USCIS Case Status website. USCIS processing times vary, and it can take up to three months to receive a response on an application. Check"
