    "ChunkText": "the process to renew a visa is no different than applying for a visa the first time, though the first visa should be the toughest and visa applications after the first one are typically easier since you have already convinced the consular officers of your intentions in the US during your first visa interview.",
    "ContextBefore": "if your visa is expired and you are outside of the us, you must visit a US embassy to get a new f-1 visa before returning to the us. to renew your visa, you will actually apply for a new one, following the same process as the first time you applied for an f-1 visa.",
    "ContextAfter": "please be sure to carry a transcript from umbc and any other school you have attended since your last visa application, to show that you have been enrolled as required during your time in the US in f-1 status. some countries do have US embassies that can waive the visa interview if you are a returning student."
