Students will also be able to view their OPT I-20 in their request. Students must print out and sign their OPT I-20 with ink. Submitting an application without a signature will likely result in a denial. Finally, students must upload all required documentation and submit their I-765 application using the USCIS online application system. The current fee for submitting an I-765 is $410. The fee is increasing to $470 and will go into effect on April 1, 2024.

Students can track the status of their application by entering their case number on the USCIS Case Status website. USCIS processing times vary,"
