    "ChunkText": "please note, unfortunately the immigration rules do not allow a healthy pregnancy or child birth to be considered for a medical rcl, though a pregnancy or birth with complications can be considered. please see our section on pregnancy and childbirth in the US for more information.",
    "ContextBefore": "please note, this kind of support from a professional counselor usually requires multiple visits and building a relationship with center staff, so they can best help address these concerns.",
    "ContextAfter": "there is a one-year limit for a student to use a medical rcl throughout the entire degree program, so students with very serious conditions that are highly disruptive to their studies for a term beyond one year should consider relocating outside the US for their care, or applying to change their immigration status to b-2 status, which allows visitors to remain in the US specifically for medical treatment."
