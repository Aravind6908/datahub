    "ChunkText": "please be sure to work carefully with your academic advisor to choose classes from the other school that will transfer back to umbc and will count towards your general requirements or major.",
    "ContextBefore": "if you drop a class during the semester, you will not receive a refund. please refer to the refund schedule for semester-specific deadlines. taking courses at another school while also attending umbc you are welcome to take up to half of your credits at another school while attending umbc and while your I-20 is at umbc.",
    "ContextAfter": "this can only be up to half of your total credits during a fall or spring semester, but in summer or winter sessions you can take as many credits as you like at another school without enrolling at umbc, since enrollment during those sessions is not required, unless you plan to complete your academic program during a summer term."
