    "Text": "reviewed. There are currently (as of 2021) a total of 85,000 H-1B\u2019s available each year. 20,000 of these are reserved for advanced degree holders only (Masters and PhD graduates), and all applicants are included in the remaining 65,000, including advanced degree holders that were not selected in the first 20,000. The applications to be reviewed are selected at random from the pool of applications. Second, if you are selected, your employer can then submit a complete H-1b petition for you within 90 days. Your employer will receive a receipt for you after submitting the complete H-1b petition. Third, after being receipted, your application is eventually reviewed and a decision is made. If it is approved, your H-1B status does not actually take effect until October 1. Two Ways to change to H-1b: Change of Status and Consular Processing Change of status means the petition is asking to change your status to H-1b in the US, without leaving the country. Consular processing means the change to H-1b will only take place after the H-1b is approved AND the person leaves the US, applies for an H-1b visa, and returns to the US with the H-1b visa. Change of status considerations: Please"
