    "ChunkText": "you still need to apply for a visa stamp, but do not have to sit for another interview. please check your specific embassys website to see if this is an option at the embassy where you plan to apply for a visa. this is typically called a visa interview waiver.",
    "ContextBefore": "please be sure to carry a transcript from umbc and any other school you have attended since your last visa application, to show that you have been enrolled as required during your time in the US in f-1 status. some countries do have US embassies that can waive the visa interview if you are a returning student.",
    "ContextAfter": "please remember that you do not need a valid visa to remain the US your visa only allows you to enter the us. while you are here, your I-20 maintains your immigration status, not your visa."
