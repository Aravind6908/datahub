The process to renew a visa is no different than applying for a visa the first time, though the first visa should be the toughest and visa applications after the first one are typically easier since you have already convinced the consular officers of your intentions in the US during your first visa interview. *Please be sure to carry a transcript from UMBC and any other school you have attended since your last visa application, to show that you have been enrolled as required during your time in the US in F-1 status. Some countries do have US Embassies that can waive the visa interview if you are a returning student. You still need to apply for a visa stamp, but do not have to sit for another interview. Please check your specific embassy\u2019s website to see if this is an option at the Embassy where you plan to apply for a visa. This is typically called a \u201cVisa Interview Waiver.\u201d Please remember that you do not need a valid visa to remain the US \u2013 your visa only allows you"
