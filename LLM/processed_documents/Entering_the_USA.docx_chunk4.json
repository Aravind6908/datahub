I-515 Temporary Entry If you are missing documents when you try to enter the US, the CBP Officer can choose to refuse you entry to the US, or give you an I-515 document allowing you a temporary stay in the US, during which time you will need to provide the missing documents. The I-515 form will indicate exactly what information you need to provide, what the deadline is to provide it, and how to submit it. You are only allowed in the US for 30 days with an I-515, so will need to address the issue quickly. After you submit the required documents, you will receive a new I\u201394 that will grant you the typical length of time in the US.
