    "Text": "Taxes for students on OPT Students on OPT are required to pay taxes on their income, and will complete a W-4 tax form with their new employer before they begin to be paid. Determining Tax Status It is important to recognize the difference between a Resident and Non-Resident Alien (NRA) for tax purposes. Most typically, a student or graduate in F-1 status that has been in the US for less than 5 years will be considered an NRA for tax purposes. Students in the US for more than 5 years are usually considered Residents for tax purposes. Please note this is not related to permanent residency in any way. Your tax structure will change when you become a resident for tax purposes. The \u201cSubstantial Presence Test\u201d that you do with your tax return each year will determine this status for you. NRA Taxes and FICA (Social Security and Medicare) Please note, NRA students or graduates are not required to pay FICA tax (Medicare and Social Security taxes). This is often a point of confusion for employers not used to hiring NRA employees.
