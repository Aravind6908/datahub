    "ChunkText": "naming conventions in the US assume an individual will have a first and last name, so not having these will make official matters such as working and driving in the US more complicated for you. its much easier to make this change before leaving your country rather than after arriving in the us.",
    "ContextBefore": "if your passport does not give a first name or a last name, we would recommend that you consider adjusting your passport if this is an option for you.",
    "ContextAfter": "apply as early as possible to avoid long delays in getting a visa appointment close to the start of a semester if your nearest embassy has a long wait time to get an appointment, you can look up other possible embassies you could visit and see how long it takes to get an appointment."
