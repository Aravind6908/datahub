    "ChunkText": "sometimes something as simple as a misunderstanding on the part of the officer interviewing you can lead to a denial.",
    "ContextBefore": "when the processing is complete, if the application is approved then the applicant will be notified to collect their passport with the US f-1 visa stamp appropriately. visa denials if your visa application is denied, you can apply again. there are instances where students have received their visa easily at a second interview.",
    "ContextAfter": "most denials are based on 214b this means you did not establish that you are eligible for an f-1 visa, usually because you did not satisfy the visa officer that your goals in the US are in line with the kind of visa you are asking for. be sure to ask the officer interviewing you for a more specific reason!"
