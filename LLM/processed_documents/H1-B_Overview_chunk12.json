    "ContextBefore": "OPT cap gap and h-1b start date of october 1 even after it is approved, h-1b status is not actually active until october 1 each year.",
    "ContextAfter": "the OPT cap gap requires that your OPT end after april 1, while you have a pending h-1b application and receipt. if this is your case, your OPT end date before oct 1 would be automatically extended to september 30, so that you there is no interruption in your ability to work on OPT before your h-1b takes effect."
