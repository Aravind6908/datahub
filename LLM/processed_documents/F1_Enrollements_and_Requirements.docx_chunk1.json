Online courses can be taken as much as you like in summer or winter sessions, when enrollment is not required, unless you plan to complete your academic program during a summer term, in which case you must follow all full-time enrollment rules and are only permitted to take at most one fully-online course. Possible Exceptions to Full-Time Enrollment Requirements The immigration language for receiving permission to enroll less than full-time is a \u201cReduced Course Load (RCL)\u201d. Any RCL MUST be approved in advance with ISSS, before the semester begins in which you plan to be enrolled part-time. In some cases, an RCL can be approved during the semester if you need to drop the class. Please note these rules are very strict and the exceptions are not very accommodating \u2013 please plan appropriately! 1. Last Semester Duration: Last semester before graduation only Limitations: Up to 2 semesters, if the student later discovers that their last semester will not actually be their last (requires an I-20 extension) Enrollment Requirements: Only required to enroll in credits"
