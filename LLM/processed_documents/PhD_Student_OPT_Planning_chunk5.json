    "ChunkText": "this option should be used very carefully, as students interested in using the stem extension should complete their degree and have it awarded before their first year of OPT runs out, to be eligible to apply for the extension.",
    "ContextBefore": "2. end I-20 during phd research; begin OPT while completing degree if cpt has been used to the maximum or is not appropriate for a job you would like to take, phd students can choose to end their I-20 any time after their required course work is complete, and begin opt.",
    "ContextAfter": "if the degree is not completed after the OPT ends and the student does not choose to use the stem extension, the student would have to leave the US to complete their degree remotely, as you could not return to regular student status after opt."
