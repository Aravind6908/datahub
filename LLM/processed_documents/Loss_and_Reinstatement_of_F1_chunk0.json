    "ChunkText": "loss and reinstatement of f-1 status if an f-1 student breaks an immigration rule, they may lose their status in the us. this means that their f-1 status in the US is no longer valid, and they have no legal immigration status in the US at all. the I-20 is also terminated and is thus also no longer valid.",
    "ContextBefore": "",
    "ContextAfter": "f-1 status can be lost most commonly from lack of full-time enrollment, allowing the I-20 to expire inappropriately, or working without proper authorization. please monitor your immigration status carefully and read email reminders from isss to avoid losing your status!"
