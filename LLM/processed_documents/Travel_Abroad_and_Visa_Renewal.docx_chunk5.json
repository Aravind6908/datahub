Please request a letter from ISSS if you plan to use this method of travel, as sometimes the border guards don\u2019t recall this exception and a letter that cites this regulation will help make sure you have a smooth return to the US. Please note this option is unfortunately not available for students from countries considered by the US government to be State Sponsors of Terrorism. Please read more about Automatic Visa Revalidation, and see the list of eligible destinations, here. Please also note this rule is only for re-entry to the US, and does not play a role in allowing you to enter the country you plan to visit. You will need to make sure you understand and comply with the requirements for a person from your country to enter the country you plan to visit."
