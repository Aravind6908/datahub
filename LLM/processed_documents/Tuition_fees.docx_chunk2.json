    "Text": "funding through an Assistantship, which can be a TA (Teaching assistantship), RA (Research Assistantship), or GA (Graduate Assistantship). The student will work in this position on campus up to 20 hours per week, and in return typically receives tuition remission, health insurance, and an annual stipend. Assistantship offers are usually given by your academic department and as each department manages this process differently, questions concerning assistantship opportunities should be directed to your department. Occasionally, other assistantship opportunities can become available outside of departments, such as through the Graduate Student Association or other on-campus offices. These are not advertised in a specific location, but are often included in the Graduate School\u2019s email newsletters. Additional information is available on the Graduate School\u2019s website, here. Please note that scholarships and assistantships are extremely competitive and not all students will receive these opportunities."
