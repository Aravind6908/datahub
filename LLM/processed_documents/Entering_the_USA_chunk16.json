    "ChunkText": "i-515 temporary entry if you are missing documents when you try to enter the us, the cbp officer can choose to refuse you entry to the us, or give you an i-515 document allowing you a temporary stay in the us, during which time you will need to provide the missing documents.",
    "ContextBefore": "this is meant to provide officers with an opportunity to review your documents more closely without holding up the line of others waiting to enter the us. you might need to wait, and will eventually speak with a cbp officer in person to address their questions. if you are missing any documents, you would need to go through secondary inspection.",
    "ContextAfter": "the i-515 form will indicate exactly what information you need to provide, what the deadline is to provide it, and how to submit it. you are only allowed in the US for 30 days with an i-515, so will need to address the issue quickly."
