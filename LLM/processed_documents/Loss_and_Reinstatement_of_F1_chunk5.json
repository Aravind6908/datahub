    "ChunkText": "reinstatement by travelling abroad a student who is out of status can also choose to work with isss for a new i-20, pay the new sevis fee, and travel abroad with the new i-20. this often requires an application for a new visa as well, if your current visa is expired.",
    "ContextBefore": "the reinstatement application must be submitted within 5 months of the student losing their f-1 status. please note that during the time that reinstatement is pending, the student is not eligible for f-1 benefits, such as work on campus or off campus through cpt or opt. students seeking reinstatement should contact isss directly for individualized guidance.",
    "ContextAfter": "upon returning to the US with the new i-20, the students status is regained. please note that this method is dangerous for certain kinds of offenses that do not allow return to the us, such as working without authorization or remaining in the US for a long time after losing status."
