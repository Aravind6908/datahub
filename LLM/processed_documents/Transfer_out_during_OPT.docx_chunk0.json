Please also note that students on OPT cannot begin a new degree program in the US while on OPT \u2013 your I-20 must be transferred to begin a new degree program. Coursework outside of a degree can be pursued during OPT, such as coursework for personal enjoyment, a certificate program, or preparatory courses, such as pre-requisites, for a new degree program."
