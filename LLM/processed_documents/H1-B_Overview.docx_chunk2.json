    "Text": "note, you can NOT travel outside the US while your H-1B application is pending through a change of status, or even after it is approved, before it becomes active on October 1. The next time you travel abroad after Oct 1, you will need to apply for an H-1B visa stamp in your passport in order to return to the US. As with any visa type, you can only apply for the new visa while you are outside the US. Consular Processing considerations: If you are changing via Consular Processing, you would need to wait until after October 1, and at some point after that date leave the US and apply for an H-1b visa. You must have your own work permission (such as valid OPT/STEM OPT) until you return from your trip to get your H-1b visa. You will not have H-1b work permission or status until you return with the H-1b visa. OPT Cap Gap and H-1B start date of October 1 Even after it is approved, H-1B status is not actually active until October 1 each year. This means that you need a form of work authorization that is NOT H-1B until Oct 1. For F-1 students"
