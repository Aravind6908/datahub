    "Text": "Packing Tips Climate and clothing: Maryland has a varying climate with four distinct seasons: spring, summer, fall and winter. During these seasons, temperatures vary considerably. Spring (March \u2013 May) and Fall (September \u2013 November) are mild and pleasant, with some chilly days. Temperatures can range around 50\u00b0- 75\u00b0F (10\u00b0- 24\u00b0C). Rain is common, though there are many clear days as well. Winter (December \u2013 February/March) is often very cold, with occasional snow showers. Temperatures usually range from about 20\u00b0- 40\u00b0F (-7\u00b0- 4\u00b0C). Summer (June \u2013 August) is hot and sunny. Temperatures usually range from 75\u00b0- 95\u00b0F (24\u00b0- 35\u00b0C). Student style of dress varies tremendously. Some students dress extremely informally, while some prefer to dress more formally. Additionally, UMBC has both indoor and outdoor pools, and the Atlantic Ocean beaches are only a few hours\u2019 drive away, so if you like, swimwear may also be useful. There are also many opportunities for athletic wear, whether for exercising on campus or hiking, biking, engaging in water sports, or otherwise enjoying Maryland\u2019s bountiful outdoor recreational opportunities all year long. Personal items: Bring items that are not only essential to your studies, but equally important to your well-being. Music, traditional dress, photographs, games, books,"
