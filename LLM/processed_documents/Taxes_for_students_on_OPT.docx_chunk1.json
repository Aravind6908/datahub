    "Text": "and UMBC\u2019s Tax Prep Program (such as \u201cSprintax\u201d) UMBC provides a login code to the Sprintax Program for all current F-1 international students each year, which assists students with their required tax return each year. Students that have graduated from UMBC and are currently on OPT or the OPT STEM Extension can request a login code if additional codes are available. The ISSS office will assign codes to all current students, then invite any graduates to request a login code if available. Please watch your email around February each year for updates from ISSS concerning the availability of Sprintax Prep login codes. Please note, Sprintax can only be used for individuals that are still NRA\u2019s for tax purposes. Once you become a Resident for tax purposes, you will not be able to use this program, but can use other programs such as TurboTax on your own."
