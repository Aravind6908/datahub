    "ChunkText": "2. end I-20 during phd research; begin OPT while completing degree if cpt has been used to the maximum or is not appropriate for a job you would like to take, phd students can choose to end their I-20 any time after their required course work is complete, and begin opt.",
    "ContextBefore": "current students working on their research are also eligible for cpt, which we encourage you to use as much as possible before deciding to apply for opt. part-time cpt is unlimited, and full-time cpt can be used up to 12 months before affecting OPT in any way. full-time cpt over 12 months will make a student ineligible for opt.",
    "ContextAfter": "this option should be used very carefully, as students interested in using the stem extension should complete their degree and have it awarded before their first year of OPT runs out, to be eligible to apply for the extension."
