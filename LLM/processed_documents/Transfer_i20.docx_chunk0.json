    "Text": "Transfer your I-20 to UMBC For students that are already in the US in F-1 status, if you plan to begin your studies at UMBC you can simply transfer your current I-20 to UMBC. Your SEVIS ID will stay the same, but your I-20 will change to reflect the new school, new academic program, and new funding information. After you are admitted to UMBC, your most recent school will need to release your SEVIS record (your I-20 record) to UMBC. The SEVIS school code for UMBC is: BAL214F00062000. Requesting a UMBC I-20 Once admitted, you will receive an email from our office directing you to complete a New Student Request application.
