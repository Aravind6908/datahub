    "ChunkText": "change of status versus consular processing explanation cos: change is done in the us, no new visa acquired. need to prove you followed all rules while in the US as part of the process. usually takes effect oct 1 of the application year. next time you leave the us, you need to apply for an h-1b visa.",
    "ContextBefore": "why this is important uscis can choose to deny an application for example, to change status to h-1b if these rules have not all been followed. for example, they can choose to deny if a change in employment or address was reported more than 10 days after the change took place.",
    "ContextAfter": "consular processing: application is only if you and your position qualify under the h-1b rules. does not consider if you followed all rules while in the us. change does not actually take place until you leave the US and get the h-1b visa, so need to have optstem OPT until that time to continue working."
