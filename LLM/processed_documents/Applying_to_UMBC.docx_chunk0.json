    "Text": "Applying to UMBC If you are ready to apply to UMBC, your application process will vary by the kind of program you are applying for. Undergraduate Students Freshmen and transfer students will work with the UMBC Office of Undergraduate Admission \u2013 https://undergraduate.umbc.edu/ to complete an application and submit required documents. You can also research different majors, programs, resources, scholarships and opportunities with this office. Please find the application, information about required documents, deadlines and more here. Undergraduate students apply to UMBC in general, and once admitted, can choose a major. Some majors have entrance requirements. Please note that questions about the application process should be directed to the Admissions office directly, as ISSS is not involved in this process. Graduate Students Graduate (Master\u2019s and PhD) applicants can apply for admission through the Graduate School. Deadlines, funding information, application requirements, program lists and contacts, and more can be found on their website. Graduate students will apply to a specific program, and their application is reviewed first by their department and then by the Graduate School. If you have specific questions about a program or a pending application to the Graduate School, the department you have applied to will be your best"
