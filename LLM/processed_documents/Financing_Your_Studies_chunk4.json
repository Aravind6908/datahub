    "ChunkText": "each department manages this process differently, so questions concerning assistantship opportunities should be directed to your academic department. occasionally, other assistantship opportunities can become available outside of departments, such as through the graduate student association or other on-campus offices. these are not advertised in a specific location, but are often included in the graduate schools email newsletters.",
    "ContextBefore": "the student will work in this position on campus for 20 hours per week, and in return typically receives tuition remission, health insurance, and an annual stipend typically ranging from $12,000 $25,000. assistantship offers are usually given by your academic department, often based on your application documents.",
    "ContextAfter": "please note that scholarships and assistantships are extremely competitive, especially for current students, so please do not plan your finances assuming that you can find a scholarship after you arrive on campus. private scholarships students that receive scholarships from outside organizations are usually welcome to apply them at umbc."
