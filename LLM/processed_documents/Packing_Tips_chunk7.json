    "ChunkText": "nearby stores, including wal-mart, target, ross, multiple malls, and more, provide opportunities to purchase most things you may need. if you will be living off-campus, furniture may or may not be provided and you may have to purchase or rent your own. if you can, contact the landlord prior to arriving and get housing details.",
    "ContextBefore": "furniture bedding: if you will be living on campus in the residence halls or apartments, basic furniture is provided, but bed linens, blankets, pillows, and towels are not. students living on campus will be contacted by the office of residential life with packing lists, suggested items, and items that are not allowed, such as pets or open flames, like candles.",
    "ContextAfter": "money: it is a good idea to exchange some currency for u.s. dollars before your departure or upon arrival at the US airport, but you should not travel with large amounts of cash, as there is danger of loss or theft."
