    "Text": "Change of Education or Degree Level A \u201cChange of Education Level\u201d means you will continue your studies at UMBC, but are starting a new degree program. This could be English students beginning a degree program, Bachelor\u2019s degree students transitioning to Master\u2019s, or Master\u2019s students transitioning to PhD\u2019s. This could also be starting a second degree at UMBC at the same degree level. Since you will remain at UMBC in this situation to start your new degree program, the process to adjust your I-20 for this new program is relatively simple. Change of Education Level Requirements First, you must be admitted to the new program or degree you plan to pursue Next, you need to prepare updated proof of available funding for the new degree program. You can find more details on the funding requirements here. For students with scholarships from their home governments, please note that you will need an updated Financial Guarantee or Scholarship offer, specific to the new degree program, from your scholarship organization before we can make a new I-20 for you. Process to Apply for a new I-20 for the new degree program: Login to your ISSS Portal Click on \u201cSearch Forms\u201d in the top right"
