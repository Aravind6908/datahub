    "ChunkText": "where to apply for a new f-1 visa most students can apply for a new f-1 visa at any US embassy around the world, and are not limited to the embassies in their own country.",
    "ContextBefore": "please remember that you do not need a valid visa to remain the US your visa only allows you to enter the us. while you are here, your I-20 maintains your immigration status, not your visa.",
    "ContextAfter": "its best to make sure the embassy you are considering visiting accepts applications of third party nationals individuals whose country of citizenship is not the us, and not the country they are visiting for the visa interview. for example, students will sometimes travel to canada to apply for a new visa if this fits their situation."
