However, certain circumstances may require additional time for students to complete their studies and graduate.

After your current I-20 end date passes, we can no longer extend the date into the future. It is important to plan ahead for this deadline. Although International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) sends reminders before the I-20 end date, it is your responsibility to ensure timely application for an extension.
