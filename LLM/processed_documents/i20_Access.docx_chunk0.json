It will be attached to your original request under the \u201cDocuments\u201d tab. Please review the uploaded I-20 to verify that all of the information is correct. If your I-20 requires any changes, please submit a help ticket and let us know. Can I use this electronic copy of a signed I-20 to apply for a visa? Yes, all I-20s are issued electronically by our office. You will need to print the signed I-20, sign it in ink with a blue pen, and then take that physical document to your visa appointment. You will carry this document with you through immigration as well. If I defer my admission to a new semester, do I need a new I-20? What if I will attend my first semester remotely from home? Your I-20 has a program start date that must reflect the first semester you will be PHYSICALLY on UMBC\u2019s campus. If you have been issued an I-20 for a previous semester, but will not physically come to"
