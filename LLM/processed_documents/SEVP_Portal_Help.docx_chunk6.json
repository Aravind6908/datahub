    "Text": "we can make sure your email address is entered correctly in your immigration record. You receive an email about the Portal from an email address other than UMBC ISSS staff or do-not-reply.sevp@ice.dhs.gov: This is likely a scam, please do not respond to any email not from us or the government email noted here! SEVP is concerned that scammers may target students on OPT with fake emails about the Portal to try to get your personal information. If you receive an email you aren\u2019t sure about, please contact us and we can help determine if it is legitimate. You asked ISSS to make a change in your immigration record today, but you don\u2019t see the change in the Portal yet: There is a one-day delay in when information entered directly into the SEVIS immigration system is updated in the Portal. Try again after one day to verify the change.
