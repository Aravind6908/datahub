    "ChunkText": "the OPT cap gap requires that your OPT end after april 1, while you have a pending h-1b application and receipt. if this is your case, your OPT end date before oct 1 would be automatically extended to september 30, so that you there is no interruption in your ability to work on OPT before your h-1b takes effect.",
    "ContextBefore": "this means that you need a form of work authorization that is not h-1b until oct 1. for f-1 students on opt, often your OPT might last until or beyond oct 1. however, the OPT cap gap also exists in case your OPT expires before that time.",
    "ContextAfter": "please note that if your OPT ends before april 1, the cap gap will not be an option. it will also not be an option if your h-1b application is not receipted selected for review."
