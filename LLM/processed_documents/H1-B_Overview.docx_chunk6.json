    "Text": "suggestions to make certain positive changes to H-1B status including to increase the number of available H-1B\u2019s each year; to allow H-4 dependents the ability to work in the US once their H-1B spouse has filed with their employer for Employment-Based Permanent Residency; and the possibility of making the Employment-Based Permanent Residency option easier for employers to begin, so that employers that want to sponsor an employee do not necessarily have to use H-1B status first as is usually the current practice. While there are absolutely no changes that are definite at this point, we will continue to watch the lawmakers\u2019 actions and inform the international community at UMBC of any relevant changes when they become more concrete.
