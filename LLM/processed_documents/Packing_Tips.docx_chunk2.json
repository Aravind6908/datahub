    "Text": "malls, and more, provide opportunities to purchase most things you may need. If you will be living off-campus, furniture may or may not be provided and you may have to purchase or rent your own. If you can, contact the landlord prior to arriving and get housing details. Money: It is a good idea to exchange some currency for U.S. dollars before your departure or upon arrival at the US airport, but you should not travel with large amounts of cash, as there is danger of loss or theft. If you anticipate bringing large sums of money to the United States, ask a bank about the safest and most convenient means of carrying or transferring funds. Travelers checks are a convenient and safe way of transporting funds. Keep in mind foreign currencies cannot be used in the U.S. ISSS will host representatives from PNC bank before the semester begins who can aid students with setting up a bank account if they wish."
