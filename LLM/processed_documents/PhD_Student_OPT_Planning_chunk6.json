    "ChunkText": "if the degree is not completed after the OPT ends and the student does not choose to use the stem extension, the student would have to leave the US to complete their degree remotely, as you could not return to regular student status after opt.",
    "ContextBefore": "this option should be used very carefully, as students interested in using the stem extension should complete their degree and have it awarded before their first year of OPT runs out, to be eligible to apply for the extension.",
    "ContextAfter": "please consider these options carefully, and feel free to contact the isss office for assistance with planning to ensure the most effective use of opt."
