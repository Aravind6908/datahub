    "ChunkText": "this can only be up to half of your total credits during a fall or spring semester, but in summer or winter sessions you can take as many credits as you like at another school without enrolling at umbc, since enrollment during those sessions is not required, unless you plan to complete your academic program during a summer term.",
    "ContextBefore": "please be sure to work carefully with your academic advisor to choose classes from the other school that will transfer back to umbc and will count towards your general requirements or major.",
    "ContextAfter": "please note that if you will take some credits at another school during a semester, you will need to provide isss with a copy of your course schedule."
