Students arriving by plane will go through these steps at the first airport they land in that is inside the US, regardless of if you have a connecting flight to another US city. Students arriving by car will go through this process in a checkpoint before crossing into the US. All individuals entering the US will be given a declarations form to complete, where you report certain kinds of items that you are bringing into the US. Please complete this form before arriving at the border. Please remember that students entering the US in F-1 status for the first time can only enter up to 30 days before the I-20 start date!
